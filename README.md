This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Straight to Basket

Creating a food order journey with React and Material UI for mobile and desktop. The aim of this project is to upskill on the following:

* Creating a React app from scratch with a full journey
* Use mobile first design principles, and using [Mui breakpoints](https://material-ui.com/customization/breakpoints/) for styling changes to desktop
* Learning and using the `useReducer` and `useContext` React hooks
* Using TDD to create new components  
* Improve my understanding of jest mocks

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
